## Project Altair | An Autonomous Serving Robot 

Purpose: Servant/helper, autonomous navigation, balance of precision and adaptability

Main Goals:
- Autonomous Navigation with LIDAR and Camera
- Follows user around
- Able to carry multiple items inside its storage compartments

To-Do:

- Set-up Raspberry PI 5 with ROS and necessary software
    - Software List:
        - ROS
        - others
        - etc

- Test LIDAR
- Regather electric components again


- Create a base frame
   - Maybe out of a plastic box? If I can't use school aluminium
- Make a electronics layer to slot into the frame,
    - Can drill holes and other stuff for electronic connections
    - Makes it easier to switch out
    - Easy & neater wiring
- CAD a motor holder for my torquenado motors
    - Fix onto frame using zipties (for now)
- Design/find wheels that can fit nicely on my motors
