# Project Altair | An Autonomous Serving Robot 

Purpose: Servant/helper, autonomous navigation, balance of precision and adaptability
### Current Availiable Features & Functionality
- Plastic Base Frame
- Basic and Caster wheels ready for attachment

  
&nbsp;
### Main Goals:
- Autonomous Navigation with LIDAR and Camera
- Follows user around
- Able to carry multiple items inside its storage compartments

&nbsp;
### To-Do:
Admin:
- Read own wiki to catch myself up
- Recap on progress & YT playlist


Software:
- Set-up Raspberry PI 5 with ROS and necessary software
    - Software List:
        - ROS
        - VScode
        - Gazebo
        - 
- WebSockets w/ simple WiFi-enabled control

Electrical:
- Test LIDAR
- Regather electric components again
- Get encoder readings to work

Mechanical:
- Make a electronics layer to slot into the frame,
    - Can drill holes and other stuff for electronic connections
    - Makes it easier to switch out
    - Easy & neater wiring
- ReCAD a motor holder (L-Brackets) for my torquenado motors 
    - Fix onto frame using zipties (for now)
- RePrint motor split L-brackets
